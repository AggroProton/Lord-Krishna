            <p class="para" id="po">Lord Krishna, revered as the eighth avatar of the god Vishnu, is one of the most beloved and complex figures in Hinduism. From his birth as a divine child in Mathura to his mischievous youth in Vrindavan, his life is a tapestry of miraculous feats and playful pastimes. He is celebrated as the butter-stealing child, the enchanting flutist whose music captivates all, and the protector of the innocent. His early life stories are a source of profound joy and devotion for millions, symbolizing the accessibility of the divine in everyday life.</p>

            <h2 class="head" id="ht">The Supreme Teacher</h2>
            <p class="para" id="pt">Beyond his enchanting youth, Krishna's life embodies the highest ideals of dharma and wisdom. As a young man, he became a strategic warrior and a divine statesman, guiding the Yadava clan and establishing the city of Dwaraka. His most significant role, however, came during the great war of the Mahabharata. Serving as the charioteer to the Pandava prince Arjuna, he delivered the timeless spiritual discourse known as the Bhagavad Gita. This sacred text, a dialogue on duty, devotion, and the nature of the self, remains a foundational guide for righteous living and spiritual liberation, teaching that true peace comes from selfless action and unwavering faith.</p>
